# Talk: Parallel and Asynchronous Programming in Python / Data Science

Parallel and Asynchronous Programming in Python / Data Science
 
Talk first given at FOSSASIA Summit 2020 on 20 March 2020.
 
Newer iteration of my talk on [parallel processing in Python](https://github.com/hweecat/talk_1_pythonugsg_parallelprocessing_python), with new codes written for both multithreading and multiprocessing.
 
Feel free to file a GitHub issue on this repo if you would like to discuss further on parallel and asynchronous processing in Python - I'd love to hear your perspectives (and dig your brains)!
